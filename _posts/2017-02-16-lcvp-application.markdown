<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being optimist at this time is the most valuable treasure that someone can have. Because we see too much evil and bad thing in the world around us and thinking the evil has won and there is no hope. But actually this is the result of being too much pessimist. This view poisons the humans to stop any activity that can make the world a better place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see a lot of my friend is pessimist and they always angry, mad and hopeless. They are doomed to only see the bad side of view. But being optimist isn&rsquo;t being blind to badness, it is about seeing goodness beside every badness in the world. Being optimist is &ldquo;never losing your hope&rdquo; and it is what exactly bad things wants. They want you to losing your hope and then they will own you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Optimist is Contagious. It can be easily shared. Just being optimist is helping others to open their visions and see the good thing around them. And this is the time that they will fight for the goodness against any badness. Someone once told me a quote:</p>
<p>Only 10 percent of an optimist thought will be happened and most of a pessimist words is true. But every great changes in the world was happened because of optimists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working in AIESEC helping me to be optimist. It also show me a path to how can I implement my ideas and make the world a better place. It help me to see I&rsquo;m not alone! Now it is my turn to use the opportunity that AIESEC offers everyone. This is why I applying for LCVP elections in AIESEC Shiraz LC.</p>
